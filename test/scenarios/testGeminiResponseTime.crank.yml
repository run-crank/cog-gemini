description: Asks a simple question to Gemini 1.0 and checks if the response time is less than 1 second

tokens:
  test:
    trivialPrompt: what is 1 plus 1
    operator: be less than

    modela: gemini-1.0-pro
steps:
- step: Gemini model {{test.modela}} response time in response to "{{test.trivialPrompt}}" should {{test.operator}} {{test.responseTime}} ms
